# Assignment 1: WordPress Site Setup

### WordPress Architecture

<p>I learned that WordPress is a site that operates similar to Wix by being a template for programmers and non programmers to use to create websites. By logging into the WordPress admin, users are able to create, edit, and approve posts, as well as many other aspects of the site.</p>

### WordPress Setup

<p>WordPress is simple to set up, and only takes a few steps. In order to be able to pull up our sites, we first had to download Local. Local allows users to develop websites locally on their computers. Once the program was downloaded, we had the option to create an account on the program, or just continue without logging in. Next, we create a WordPress site, as well as an Admin Username and Password. Once we login to the admin page, we are able to create, edit, and delete posts on the site. We were also able to approve or delete comments on a post as well.</p>
